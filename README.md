Memory Beats
Memory Beats is a classic memory and pattern recognition game that challenges players to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. It tests and improves the player's memory skills and ability to recall and reproduce patterns accurately.

How to Play
The game begins when the user presses any key.
The game displays a sequence of colors by animating and playing corresponding sounds.
The player must replicate the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
Each successful replication of the sequence advances the player to the next level, which increases the complexity of the sequence.
If the player clicks the wrong button or makes a mistake, the game ends.
The player's score is based on the number of levels completed.
The high score is recorded and stored, and the player can try to beat their previous best score.
To restart the game, the player can simply press any key.

#Additional Features
